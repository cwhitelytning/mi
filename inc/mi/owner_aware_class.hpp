/**
 * @class owner_aware_class
 * @brief A class template that provides ownership semantics.
 *
 * The owner_aware_class encapsulates an owning object,
 * offering a strict ownership model while prohibiting copy
 * and move semantics to ensure the integrity and safety of ownership.
 *
 * This class is a component of a broader mechanism designed
 * to manage resources and enforce ownership policies
 * within complex systems.
 *
 * @tparam OwnerType The type of the owned object.
 * @tparam AnchorType A type used as an anchor for additional ownership mechanisms,
 *                    defaults to anchor<T>.
 *
 *                    This parameter allows customizing the ownership behavior,
 *                    for instance, facilitating unique ownership or supporting
 *                    shared ownership depending on the anchor's implementation.
 *
 * The class is part of an architecture that strictly forbids the copying and moving
 * of owning objects to prevent any unauthorized or accidental ownership transfers,
 * thereby enhancing the security and reliability of resource management.
